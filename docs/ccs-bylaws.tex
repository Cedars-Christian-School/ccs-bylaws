Members should be held within the earlier of nine months after the

not held on the day designated herein for any annual meeting, or at an
adjournment thereof, the Members will cause the election to be held at

Member and delivered to Cedars for inclusion in the minutes or filing
with Cedar's records. A Member's attendance at a meeting (a)~waives
objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless

meeting or transacting business at the meeting, and (b)~waives any

determination of Members. The Corporation shall keep at all times, at
the Corporation's principal office, a complete and accurate list of
all Members entitled to vote by the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation. After fixing a record date for notice of a meeting, the

with each other participant. A Member's participation in a meeting
held in a manner provided for in this section constitutes that
Member's presence at the meeting.

  written consent which describes the action taken, is signed by the
  Members representing at least 80\% of the votes entitled to be cast
  on the action and is delivered to Cedars for inclusion in the
  minutes or filing with Cedar's records. Requests for written
  consents must be delivered to all Members entitled to vote. Action
  taken by written consent is effective when the last Member necessary
  to meet the 80\% requirement signs the consent, unless a prior or
  subsequent effective date is specified in the consent.
\item

  the Members may take any action electronically as contemplated by

  clarity and avoidance of doubt, subject to the requirements of the
  UETA, written consent by the Members can be undertaken via email, or
  other electronic record communication, if the written consent
  setting forth the action to be taken is circulated to all Members
  via email, or other electronic record communication, and at least
  80\% of the Members indicate their approval by return email or other
  approved electronic record communication. The Corporation shall
  confirm with each Member the electronic address or addresses, such
  as an email address or text message number, for that Member to be
  used for purposes of sending and receiving email, text or other
  electronic record communications, and for the purpose of notices to
  and from the Corporation, and shall maintain such information as
  part of the Corporation's current records, which may be maintained
  electronically. The Corporation shall provide its address, and the
  electronic addresses of the other Members, to be used for purposes
  of taking such action. The Board of Directors may provide for any
  particular requirements, method or means for taking action
  electronically and for notices to and from the Corporation and its
  Members, in which case the action to be taken shall be taken in
  accordance with such requirements, method, or means.

\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\item
  profess to be a Christian and live as such;
\item
  be a man committed to a Biblical view of authority and sexuality,
  particularly God's ordering of the sexes, as described by
  the~Declaration of Doctrine and Policies Concerning Sexuality,
  Chapter 28, Evangel Presbytery Book of Church Order;
\item
  be a communicant member and regular attendee of a Bible-believing
  church; and

  hold to Benjamin B. Warfield's ``A Brief and Untechnical Statement of
  the Reformed Faith.''
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{4.3 Election and Term}\label{election-and-term}

The Members have the exclusive authority to elect and remove
directors. The Directors will be elected at the annual meeting of the
Members. The term of office of a director shall be three years.
Directors may be elected for successive terms.

\subsection{4.4 Class}\label{class}

To provide for staggered terms of office, the Directors will be
divided, as evenly as possible, into three classes with respect to the
time for which they will severally hold office and stand for election.
The terms of the Directors in the first class will expire with the
annual election by the Members to be held in the first year, the terms
of the Directors in the second class will expire at the annual
election to be held in the second year, and the terms of the Directors
in the third group will expire at the annual election to be held in
the third year; provided that, in any event and irrespective of the
expiration of their terms, the Directors of any class will remain in
office until their successors have been elected and qualified. At each
annual meeting of the Members thereafter, the Directors elected and
qualified to succeed the Directors of any class will be elected for a
term of three years expiring with the annual meeting of the Members
occurring the third year thereafter (provided that the Directors of
any class will remain in office until their successors have been
elected and qualified), so that the term of office of one class of
Directors will expire each year. If the total number of Directors is
changed, any increase or decrease in Directors will be apportioned
among the classes to maintain all groups of Directors as nearly equal
in number as possible, and any additional Director elected to any
group of Directors will hold office for a term which will expire with
the term of the Directors in such group. Each class has the same
rights and obligations.

\subsection{4.5 Number of Directors}\label{number-of-directors}

The number of Directors on the Board ("Directors") will initially be
four. The number of Directors may be changed from time to time by
resolution of the Board, provided that the number of Directors will be
set at not fewer than three and not greater than 12. No decrease in
the number of Directors will have the effect of decreasing the term of
any incumbent Director. Directors need not be residents of the State
of Indiana.

\subsection{4.6 Board Meetings}\label{board-meetings}

The President will preside over meetings of the Board, including the preparation of meeting agendas. The Board may provide, by resolution, the time and place, either within or without the State of Indiana for the holding of regular meetings, other than the annual meeting, without notice other than such resolution.

\subsection{4.7 Annual Meeting}\label{annual-meeting}

The annual meeting of the Board will be held on the First Monday of June of each year, which meeting will be held for the transaction of such business as may come before the meeting. If for any year the day fixed for the annual meeting is a legal holiday, such meeting will be held on the next succeeding business day. The annual meeting of the Board shall be held at the principal office or place of business of the Corporation or such other place either within or without the State of Indiana, as may be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice.

\subsection{4.8 Special Meeting}\label{special-meeting}

A special meeting of the Board may be called by any two Directors or the Principal. Notice to the Directors of a special meeting of the Board will be given at least five days prior to the meeting and may be delivered personally, by mail, or e-mail, to the address or e-mail address for each Director as it appears on the records of the Corporation. If mailed, such notice will be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid.

\subsection{4.9 Quorum}\label{quorum}

A majority of the Directors on the Board will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board; provided that if less than a majority of the Directors are present at said meeting, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

\subsection{4.10 Voting}\label{voting}

Each Director present will be entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at any such meeting. All motions will be decided by majority vote. If the vote is a tie, the motion does not carry.

\subsection{4.11 Meeting by Remote Communications Technology}\label{meeting-by-remote-communications-technology}

A meeting of the Board or any committee designated by the Board may be held by means of a remote electronic communications system, including videoconferencing technology or the Internet, only if each person entitled to participate in the meeting consents to the meeting being held by means of that system; and the system provides access to the meeting in a manner or using a method by which each person participating in the meeting can communicate concurrently with each other participant. A Director's participation in a meeting held in a manner provided for in this section constitutes that Director's presence at the meeting.

\subsection{4.12 Action Without Meetings}\label{action-without-meetings}

\begin{quote}
Any action required or permitted by law to be taken at any meeting of
the Board or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing,
setting forth the action so taken is signed by at least 80\% of all the
members of the Board, unless a greater number is required by statute,
by the Articles or by these Bylaws, in which case the signatures of
such greater number shall be requisite to constitute the act of the
Board or the committee. Such written consent shall be filed in the
minutes or proceedings of the Board or committee, as appropriate, and
a copy of same shall be sent to each member of the Board or committee
who did not sign such consent.

The Board of Directors may take any action electronically as
contemplated by the Indiana Uniform Electronic Transactions Act
(``UETA''). For the sake of clarity and avoidance of doubt, subject to
the requirements of the UETA, written consent by the Board of
Directors can be undertaken via email, or other electronic record
communication, if the written board consent setting forth the action
to be taken is circulated to all Board members via email, or other
electronic record communication, and the directors indicate their
approval unanimously by return email or other approved electronic
record communication. The Corporation shall confirm with each director
the electronic address or addresses, such as an email address or text
message number, for that director to be used for purposes of sending
and receiving email, text, or other electronic record communications,
and for the purpose of notices to and from the Corporation, and shall
maintain such information as part of the Corporation's current
records, which may be maintained electronically. The Corporation shall
provide its electronic address, and the electronic addresses of the
other members of the Board of Directors, to be used for purposes of
taking such action. The Board of Directors may provide for any
particular requirements, method, or means for taking action
electronically and for notices to and from the Corporation and its
directors, in which case the action to be taken shall be taken in
accordance with such requirements, method, or means.
\end{quote}

\subsection{4.13 Notice}\label{notice}

\begin{quote}
A Director may waive any notice required by these Bylaws, before or
after the date and time stated in the notice, by written waiver signed
by such Director, which waiver will be included in the minutes or
filing with the corporate records. A Director's attendance at a
meeting waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the
meeting unless the Director at the beginning of the meeting objects to
holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
\end{quote}

\subsection{4.14 Director Compensation}\label{director-compensation}

\begin{quote}
Directors as such will not receive any compensation for their services
as Directors, but by resolution of the Board may be reimbursed for
their expenses of attendance at meetings of the Board; provided, that
nothing herein contained will be construed to preclude any Director
from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving
reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered. The
Corporation shall not loan money or property to, or guarantee the
obligation of, any Director.
\end{quote}

\subsection{4.15 Resignation}\label{resignation}

\begin{quote}
A Director may resign at any time by delivering a written resignation
to the Moderator of the Members. Such resignation will be effective
upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective at some other time
or upon the happening of some other event.
\end{quote}

\subsection{4.16 Removal}\label{removal}

\begin{quote}
The Board may recommend to the Members a Director's removal. If a
Director proposes that another Director be removed, written notice of
the proposal shall be given to that Director at least ten days before
the meeting at which a recommendation of removal will be considered.
If a majority of the Board votes to recommend removal, the Session
will be notified of the recommendation.
\end{quote}

\section{5. Committees of the Board}\label{committees-of-the-board}

The Board, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors in
office, may designate and appoint one or more committees of the Board.
Each such committee need not be composed entirely of directors.
Provided, however, that if a committee is to exercise board powers,
functions, or authority, (a)~all the persons serving on the committee
must be directors, (b)~there must be at least three persons on the
committee, and (c)~the creation of the committee and the appointment of
its members shall be by a majority of all directors in office when the
action is taken. A majority of the whole committee will constitute a
quorum and the act of a majority of the members present at a meeting at
which a quorum is present will be the act of the committee.

\section{6. Officers}\label{officers}

\subsection{6.1 Elected Officers}\label{elected-officers}

\begin{quote}
The elected officers of the Corporation shall minimally consist of a
President, a Secretary and a Treasurer. The Corporation may also have
a Moderator of the Board and such other officers, both active and
honorary, as the Board may from time to time deem advisable. Such
officers will be elected by the Board at its annual meeting, and they
will hold office until their successors are elected at the next annual
meeting of the Board and are elected and qualified, unless they
earlier die, resign, or are removed from office. Any person may
simultaneously hold more than one office, except that the offices of
President and Secretary shall not be held by the same person.
\end{quote}

\subsection{6.2 Duties of Moderator of the Board}\label{duties-of-moderator-of-the-board}

\begin{quote}
If a Moderator of the Board is elected, the Moderator of the Board
will preside at all meetings of the Board at which that person may be
present and will have such other duties, powers and authority as may
be prescribed elsewhere in these Bylaws. The Board may delegate such
other authority and assign such additional duties to the Moderator of
the Board, other than those conferred by law exclusively upon the
President or another officer, as the Board may from time to time
determine.
\end{quote}

\subsection{6.3 Duties of President/Principal}\label{duties-of-presidentprincipal}

\begin{quote}
The President, who may also be referred to as the Principal, will be
the chief executive officer of the Corporation and, if a Moderator of
the Board has not been elected, that person will preside at all
meetings of the Board.

The Principal may execute all contracts, deeds and other instruments
for and on behalf of the Corporation and will do and perform all other
things for and on behalf of the Corporation as the Board will
authorize and direct. The Principal will enjoy and discharge generally
such other and further rights, powers, privileges and duties as
customarily relate and pertain to the office of President. The
Principal shall hire and oversee Teachers, Teacher's Aide, and
Administrators.

The Principal shall serve as a director, ex officio, with voice but no
vote.
\end{quote}

\subsection{6.4 Duties of Secretary}\label{duties-of-secretary}

resignation will be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to
be effective at some other time or upon the happening of some other
event. If a resignation is made effective at a future date and the

pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board provides that
the successor does not take office until the effective date. Any
officer of the Corporation may be removed from office by the Board
with or without cause, but such removal will be without prejudice to
