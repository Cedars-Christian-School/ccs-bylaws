</h2>
<p>The annual meeting of the Members will be held on the second Thursday
of May of each year, or at such other time as may be designated by the
directors in consultation with the Members. Annual meetings of the
Members should be held within the earlier of nine months after the
close of the fiscal year or 15 months after the Corporation’s last
annual meeting. The failure to hold an annual or regular meeting at a
time stated in or fixed in accordance with these Bylaws does not
affect the validity of any corporate action or work any forfeiture or
dissolution of the Corporation. Annual membership meetings shall be
held at the place specified in the notice of the meeting; otherwise,
such meeting shall be held at the Corporation’s principal office.</p>
<p>At the annual meeting of Members, the Members will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>receive a report on the activities and financial condition of the
corporation from the Principal and Treasurer (or their designees),</p></li>
<li><p>elect Directors and the President,</p></li>
<li><p>confirm the Head of School, and</p></li>
<li><p>transact such other business as may come before the meeting.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If for any year the day fixed for the annual meeting is a legal
holiday, such meeting will be held on the next succeeding business
day. The Members may provide, by resolution, the time and place,
either within or without the State of Indiana for the holding of
regular meetings, other than the annual meeting, without notice other
than such resolution. If the election of Directors is for any reason
not held on the day designated herein for any annual meeting, or at an
adjournment thereof, the Members will cause the election to be held at
a special meeting as soon as conveniently possible.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Regular Members Meetings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#regular-members-meetings"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Cedars may hold regular Membership meetings at times stated in or
fixed by a resolution of the Members. Regular Membership meetings
shall be held at the place specified in the notice of the meeting;
otherwise, such meeting shall be held at Cedars’s principal office.</p>

</h2>
<p>Special meetings of the Members may be called by the Principal, by the
Board of Directors, or by one or more petitions in writing signed,
dated and delivered by at least one tenth of the Members. Such
petition or petitions must demand a special meeting and describe the
purpose for which the meeting is to be held. Special Membership
meetings shall be held at the place specified in the notice of
meeting; otherwise, such meetings shall be held at the Corporation’s
principal office.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Notice of Members Meetings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#notice-of-members-meetings"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Written notice stating the place, date and time of any meeting of the
Members and, if the quorum of Members for the meeting is less than
one‑third or in the case of special meetings, or when otherwise
required by law, a description of the purpose or purposes for which
such meeting is called, shall be sent by electronic communication by
Cedars to each Member of record entitled to vote at such meeting, at
such electronic address as appears on the records of the Corporation,
at least ten but not more than sixty days before the date of such
meeting, on being notified of the place, date, and time thereof by the
officers or persons calling the meeting. Provided, however, any action
taken by the Members shall not be invalidated, and notice shall not be
considered improper, if notice, including oral notice, is given in a
fair and reasonable manner.
&gt;
Notice of any meeting may be waived in writing by any Member before or
after the date and time of the meeting, if the waiver is signed by the
Member and delivered to Cedars for inclusion in the minutes or filing
with Cedar’s records. A Member’s attendance at a meeting (a) waives
objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless
the Member at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the
meeting or transacting business at the meeting, and (b) waives any
valid objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting
that is not within the purposes described in the meeting notice,
unless the Member objects to considering the matter when the matter is
presented.</p>

<p>A quorum is two Elders, if there are three or more, or one ruling
Elder, if there are fewer than three, together with the Pastor, unless
a higher quorum shall be required by law or the Articles of
Incorporation. In no case may the Board of Elders conduct its business
with fewer than two present who are entitled to vote. Each Member
present will be entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a
vote at any such meeting. All motions will be decided by majority
vote. If the vote is a tie, the motion does not carry.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Voting List<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#voting-list"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The Board of Directors may fix a record date to determine the Members
entitled to notice of a Members’ meeting, to demand a special meeting,
to vote or to take any other action; provided, however, that the
record date may not exceed seventy days prior to the meeting or action
requiring a determination of Members. In the absence of action by the
Board of Directors to fix a record date as herein provided, the record
date shall be the date of the meeting or action requiring a
determination of Members. The Corporation shall keep at all times, at
the Corporation’s principal office, a complete and accurate list of
all Members entitled to vote by the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation. After fixing a record date for notice of a meeting, the
Corporation shall prepare a list of the names and electronic addresses
of the Corporation’s Members who are entitled to notice of the
Members’ meeting.</p>

</h2>
<p>A meeting of the Members or any committee designated by the Members
may be held by means of a remote electronic communications system,
including videoconferencing technology or the Internet if the system
provides access to the meeting in a manner or using a method by which
each person participating in the meeting can communicate concurrently
with each other participant. A Member’s participation in a meeting
held in a manner provided for in this section constitutes that
Member’s presence at the meeting.</p>

<p>A Director elected by the Members may be removed with or without cause
at any meeting of the Members by a majority vote, provided notice of
intention to act upon such matter shall have been given in the notice
calling such meeting.
&gt;
A vacancy on the Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative
vote of the majority of the Members. Any Director elected to fill a
vacancy on the Board will serve a term expiring as of the scheduled
expiration date of the term of that person's predecessor.</p>

<p>The final rule of faith and practice for all aspects of
Cedars—including its teaching, operations, management, and

over the interpretation and application of Holy Scripture to the work
of Cedars.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
Members may be taken without a meeting if the action is approved by
80% of the Members. The action must be evidenced by at least one (1)
written consent which describes the action taken, is signed by the
Members representing at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast
on the action and is delivered to Cedars for inclusion in the
minutes or filing with Cedar’s records. Requests for written
consents must be delivered to all Members entitled to vote. Action
taken by written consent is effective when the last Member necessary
to meet the 80% requirement signs the consent, unless a prior or
subsequent effective date is specified in the consent.</p></li>
<li><p>Subject to satisfying the requirements provided in Section 3.12(a),
the Members may take any action electronically as contemplated by
the Indiana Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”), provided
the action is initiated by the Board of Directors. For the sake of
clarity and avoidance of doubt, subject to the requirements of the
UETA, written consent by the Members can be undertaken via email, or
other electronic record communication, if the written consent
setting forth the action to be taken is circulated to all Members
via email, or other electronic record communication, and at least
80% of the Members indicate their approval by return email or other
approved electronic record communication. The Corporation shall
confirm with each Member the electronic address or addresses, such
as an email address or text message number, for that Member to be
used for purposes of sending and receiving email, text or other
electronic record communications, and for the purpose of notices to
and from the Corporation, and shall maintain such information as
part of the Corporation’s current records, which may be maintained
electronically. The Corporation shall provide its address, and the
electronic addresses of the other Members, to be used for purposes
of taking such action. The Board of Directors may provide for any
particular requirements, method or means for taking action
electronically and for notices to and from the Corporation and its
Members, in which case the action to be taken shall be taken in
accordance with such requirements, method, or means.</p></li>
