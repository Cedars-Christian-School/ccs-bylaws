<p>Other than such rights reserved for the Members under these Bylaws,
the Articles, or the Act, the affairs of Cedars will be managed by a
Board of Directors (“Board”). The Board is responsible for overseeing
all aspects of Cedars Christian School, including its teaching,
operations, management, and administration.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Qualifications of Directors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#qualifications-of-directors"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<blockquote>
<p>To qualify for and continue service on the Board, a Director must:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>profess to be a Christian and live as such;</p></li>
<li><p>be a man committed to a Biblical view of authority and sexuality,
particularly God’s ordering of the sexes, as described by
the Declaration of Doctrine and Policies Concerning Sexuality,
Chapter 28, Evangel Presbytery Book of Church Order;</p></li>
<li><p>be a communicant member and regular attendee of a Bible-believing
church; and</p></li>
<li><p>hold to Benjamin B. Warfield’s “A Brief and Untechnical Statement of
the Reformed Faith.”</p></li>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Election and Term<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#election-and-term"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The Members have the exclusive authority to elect and remove
directors. The Directors will be elected at the annual meeting of the
Members. The term of office of a director shall be three years.
Directors may be elected for successive terms.</p>
</div>
<div id="class" class="section level2" number="4.4">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Class<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#class"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>To provide for staggered terms of office, the Directors will be
divided, as evenly as possible, into three classes with respect to the
time for which they will severally hold office and stand for election.
The terms of the Directors in the first class will expire with the
annual election by the Members to be held in the first year, the terms
of the Directors in the second class will expire at the annual
election to be held in the second year, and the terms of the Directors
in the third group will expire at the annual election to be held in
the third year; provided that, in any event and irrespective of the
expiration of their terms, the Directors of any class will remain in
office until their successors have been elected and qualified. At each
annual meeting of the Members thereafter, the Directors elected and
qualified to succeed the Directors of any class will be elected for a
term of three years expiring with the annual meeting of the Members
occurring the third year thereafter (provided that the Directors of
any class will remain in office until their successors have been
elected and qualified), so that the term of office of one class of
Directors will expire each year. If the total number of Directors is
changed, any increase or decrease in Directors will be apportioned
among the classes to maintain all groups of Directors as nearly equal
in number as possible, and any additional Director elected to any
group of Directors will hold office for a term which will expire with
the term of the Directors in such group. Each class has the same
rights and obligations.</p>

<p>The number of Directors on the Board ("Directors") will initially be
four. The number of Directors may be changed from time to time by
resolution of the Board, provided that the number of Directors will be
set at not fewer than three and not greater than 12. No decrease in
the number of Directors will have the effect of decreasing the term of
any incumbent Director. Directors need not be residents of the State
of Indiana.</p>

<p>Any action required or permitted by law to be taken at any meeting of
the Board or any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing,
setting forth the action so taken is signed by at least 80% of all the
members of the Board, unless a greater number is required by statute,
by the Articles or by these Bylaws, in which case the signatures of
such greater number shall be requisite to constitute the act of the
Board or the committee. Such written consent shall be filed in the
minutes or proceedings of the Board or committee, as appropriate, and
a copy of same shall be sent to each member of the Board or committee
who did not sign such consent.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors may take any action electronically as
contemplated by the Indiana Uniform Electronic Transactions Act
(“UETA”). For the sake of clarity and avoidance of doubt, subject to
the requirements of the UETA, written consent by the Board of
Directors can be undertaken via email, or other electronic record
communication, if the written board consent setting forth the action
to be taken is circulated to all Board members via email, or other
electronic record communication, and the directors indicate their
approval unanimously by return email or other approved electronic
record communication. The Corporation shall confirm with each director
the electronic address or addresses, such as an email address or text
message number, for that director to be used for purposes of sending
and receiving email, text, or other electronic record communications,
and for the purpose of notices to and from the Corporation, and shall
maintain such information as part of the Corporation’s current
records, which may be maintained electronically. The Corporation shall
provide its electronic address, and the electronic addresses of the
other members of the Board of Directors, to be used for purposes of
taking such action. The Board of Directors may provide for any
particular requirements, method, or means for taking action
electronically and for notices to and from the Corporation and its
directors, in which case the action to be taken shall be taken in
accordance with such requirements, method, or means.</p>

<p>A Director may waive any notice required by these Bylaws, before or
after the date and time stated in the notice, by written waiver signed
by such Director, which waiver will be included in the minutes or
filing with the corporate records. A Director’s attendance at a
meeting waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the
meeting unless the Director at the beginning of the meeting objects to
holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.</p>

as Directors, but by resolution of the Board may be reimbursed for
their expenses of attendance at meetings of the Board; provided, that
nothing herein contained will be construed to preclude any Director
