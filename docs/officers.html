<blockquote>
<p>The elected officers of the Corporation shall minimally consist of a
President, a Secretary and a Treasurer. The Corporation may also have
a Moderator of the Board and such other officers, both active and
honorary, as the Board may from time to time deem advisable. Such
officers will be elected by the Board at its annual meeting, and they
will hold office until their successors are elected at the next annual
meeting of the Board and are elected and qualified, unless they
earlier die, resign, or are removed from office. Any person may
simultaneously hold more than one office, except that the offices of
President and Secretary shall not be held by the same person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a Moderator of the Board is elected, the Moderator of the Board
will preside at all meetings of the Board at which that person may be
present and will have such other duties, powers and authority as may

the chief executive officer of the Corporation and, if a Moderator of
the Board has not been elected, that person will preside at all
meetings of the Board.</p>
<p>The Principal may execute all contracts, deeds and other instruments
for and on behalf of the Corporation and will do and perform all other
things for and on behalf of the Corporation as the Board will
authorize and direct. The Principal will enjoy and discharge generally
such other and further rights, powers, privileges and duties as
customarily relate and pertain to the office of President. The

Administrators.</p>

<p>The Secretary will cause to be kept complete and correct minutes of
all meetings of the Board. That person will cause to be issued notices
of all meetings in accordance with these Bylaws or as required by law.
When authorized and directed by the Board, that person will execute
with the President all contracts, deeds, and other instruments for and
on behalf of the Corporation. The Secretary will be the legal
custodian of all books, deeds, instruments, papers, and records of the
Corporation, the inspection of which will be permitted at all
reasonable times by any Director or executive officer of the
Corporation.</p>
<p>The Secretary will attend to such correspondence as may be incidental
to that person’s office, and will perform all other duties and
discharge all other responsibilities which customarily relate and
pertain to the office of Secretary.</p>

Corporation in such depositories as the Board will authorize and
direct and, whenever requested to do so by the President or the Board,
will prepare and submit written statements, reports and accounts fully
and accurately reflecting the assets, liabilities, and financial
transactions and condition of the Corporation.</p>
<p>The Treasurer will perform such other and further duties as the Board

duties and discharge all other responsibilities that customarily
relate and pertain to the office of Treasurer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any officer of the Corporation may resign by delivering a written
resignation to the Corporation at its principal office or to the
Moderator of the Board, the President or the Secretary. Such
resignation will be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to
be effective at some other time or upon the happening of some other
event. If a resignation is made effective at a future date and the
Corporation accepts the future effective date, the Board may fill the
pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board provides that
the successor does not take office until the effective date. Any
officer of the Corporation may be removed from office by the Board
with or without cause, but such removal will be without prejudice to
the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed. Election or
appointment of an officer does not in itself create contract rights.</p>

such person or persons elected to fill such vacancy or vacancies will
serve for the unexpired term of that person’s predecessor and until a
successor is elected and qualified, or until such officer’s earlier
death, resignation or removal. Vacancies in any appointed office
occasioned by the death, resignation, or removal of any appointed
officer may be filled by the President, and such person or persons
appointed to fill such vacancy or vacancies will serve for the
unexpired term of that person’s predecessor and until a successor is
elected and qualified, or until such officer’s earlier death,
resignation or removal.</p>

<p>The compensation, if any, of the officers, will be fixed from time to
time by the Board, and no officer will be prevented from receiving
such compensation by reason of the fact that that person is also a
Director of the Corporation; provided, however, that such compensation
will include only reasonable compensation for personal services
actually rendered.</p>
